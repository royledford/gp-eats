# GP Eats

A small web app that uses google maps to show the local places to eat near the General Provision coworking space in Fort Lauderdale, FL.

The app is built in react and uses the google maps and places API to handle all the visual displays. Google firebase is used as a BaaS to hold the data for each location.

To install on local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/royledford/gp-eats.git
# switch to the folder gp-eats
yarn install
yarn start
```
